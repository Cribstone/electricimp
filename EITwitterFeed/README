Summary: This is a node.js application which monitors the Twitter stream and serves up the tweets to long polling clients as JSON data.

Instructions:

Edit the config.js file to include your Twitter developer API credentials.
Run the software on any node.js server with the command "node twitter". Use "supervisord" or equivalent to keep it running in the background.
Use HTTP to GET or POST the service path (see below) and you will either timeout or receive a JSON array back.
The JSON array will contain the following fields:

{ screen_name: "blindman2k", text: "Welcome to twitter" }

Interfaces: 

For a single track (search word), use GET /follow/:track:
For multiple tracks, POST /follow with the header "Content-Type: application/json" set and include the following raw JSON data.

{"tracks": ["searchword1", "searchword2"]}
