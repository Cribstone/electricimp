# Latency Test
This is a simple example designed to give you an idea of latency on the Electric Imp servers. When you press the button, it sends a message from the device to the server, which in turn sends a message back to the device telling it to change the state of the LED.

## Hardware
Hook a button up to Pin1 and GND
Hook an LED up to 3v3 and Pin9 (through a 370ohm resistor)
